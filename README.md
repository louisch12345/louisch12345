# 🎮 Greetings, Traveler! 🗺️✨  

Hi there! I’m a 17-year-old on a quest to become a game developer, designer, and entrepreneur with limitless possibilities ahead. 🚀  

Currently, I’m mastering Python, Lua, and Luau, and exploring the worlds of C++, C+, and C#. My journey takes me through Roblox Studio, Unreal Engine, and Unity.  

I’m applying to the CMKL AiCE Game Engineer B.Eng program 🎓 because its creative learning system fits me perfectly, and I believe it will lead to exciting opportunities.  

🌟 My ultimate goal? To become a top-notch CEO of a game company that pushes boundaries. I dream of creating a viral VRMMORPG and branching into other ventures—like real estate, restaurants, and AI projects that improve lives.
